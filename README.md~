## Patches Description

This is an application of the blur-deblur teams (name not final)
neural network focused deblur algorithms on heterogenous images.
Most deblur algorithms assume an entire image is blurred. This project
aims to deblur portions of an image. This is done in multiple steps

Preprocess

* Take a pristine image
* Create patches of blur using the fourier transform of the image and a gaussian mask

Task

* Sample random locations in the heterogenous image
* Use a suite of patch sizes to classify if the patch is blurred
* If positive, apply NN to deblur, re-insert into the image
* Repeat for all samples

Variables

* How many random samples are needed? Enough so that we can cover the entire image
